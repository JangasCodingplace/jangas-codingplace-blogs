# How ChatGPT and DALL-E affect my everyday life ... and this Blog
In December 2022 we had a big bang in our lives: Open AI deployed their LLM GPT-3. The first time where human and machines had real conversations. The first time, where an AI was not specialized for only one use case but for thousands of use cases.

Some months before in June 2022 there was another outstanding tool deployed by Open AI: Dall-E. A tool which converts text to images.

The year 2022 was the year, where AI finally arrived in the mainstream and became more than just a geeky little tool. In reality AI was already there a long time ago. I can remember I've listened to a full ai composed song `Break Free` in 2017 by AmperAI. DeepL was launched in 2017 and was able to translate text better than any other translator before by using AI. GitHub CoPilot was already added to my Editor in 2021. And to be honest: AI is for the Internet like the air which we are breathing. Recommendation Engines and Search Engines are just two examples which are everywhere and are using AI for making better results.

The shift from 2017 to the present is marked by AI stepping out of the shadows of applications and becoming an entity in its own right. Instead of concealing AI behind algorithms, we can now engage in genuine conversations with AI, allowing for a more direct and interactive experience.

## How I personally Use AI Tools
 As a full-time employed Software and Data Engineer, my reliance on Google has been a longstanding fixture in my daily routine. However, the most significant shift in my everyday life has been the change in how I seek technical information. Rather than immediately turning to Google, my first instinct now is to consult ChatGPT for answers to my technical queries.

ChatGPT goes beyond the realm of finding specific answers to specific questions. I have used it for learning purposes. Since 2022, I have been actively learning Scala, and with the help of ChatGPT, I have been able to make significant progress. In 2023, I reached a milestone by successfully writing my first applications using Scala Play Framework and Akka, with the support and guidance provided by ChatGPT. Its presence by my side has been instrumental in accelerating my learning journey and empowering me to explore new technologies and frameworks.

Even in the creation of this very blog, ChatGPT has become an important tool for me. I rely on it to generate outlines and collaboratively construct a rough plan for each article. As English is not my native language, I often use ChatGPT's assistance in refining my sentences and paragraphs. The remarkable aspect is that ChatGPT goes beyond simple semantic changes, as it understands the context and purpose of the text, allowing for more nuanced and purposeful rewrites (like this one ... lol). This AI-powered collaboration enhances the quality and clarity of my writing, making the overall blogging process more seamless and enjoyable.

Of course, it's obvious that I utilize DALL-E in my blog. I don't make any attempt to hide the fact that all my preview images are fully generated by DALL-E. Additionally, I used Looka to create my logo. Another fun fact: the alt text of my images consists of the quotes I inputted into DALL-E to generate those.
  
To provide a more precise overview of how ChatGPT assists me in writing code, there are a few key aspects to highlight. Firstly, I rely on ChatGPT to generate docstrings, written documentation, and unit tests by inputting relevant code snippets. Rather than pasting entire files into ChatGPT, I typically focus on extracting and working with individual functions and their signatures. Furthermore, ChatGPT serves as my invaluable resource for ad hoc problem-solving. Whenever I encounter a specific issue, such as uncovering all the commands executed by a specific user on an Ubuntu server, I turn to ChatGPT for swift answers. In fact: I was never good in remembering details. I am good in understanding concepts and remembering the places where to find informations - I guess there is a quote for that: "reducing mental load". It's not necessary to remember a phone number, email address or specific routes - we do have tools for that. But even as a developer, it's not always important to remember how to restart a docker container, how to use the `grep`  command at Ubuntu or how to use specific language features. It's more important to be *aware* of those functions and features.

## AI Usage will grow
The use of AI will increase significantly in the coming years. Industries across various sectors are recognizing the potential of AI and actively integrating it into their operations. The accessibility and user-friendly nature of AI tools and platforms will contribute to a broader adoption of AI, empowering individuals and organizations to leverage its power for automation, data analysis, and decision-making.

AI tools do not always need to be developed from scratch, as there is a wide range of open-source tools and APIs available that already incorporate AI capabilities. These existing resources provide developers and organizations with a head start in implementing AI solutions, saving time and effort in building AI systems from the ground up. 

But also ChatGPT and DALL-E are also used in a wide number of tools. 
We are at the beginning of a chatbot and assistance revolution. In the past, developing Chatbots involved training them on specific questions, which was challenging for smaller companies. However, we now have the ability to provide ChatGPT with information about our products or services, enabling it to respond to user questions accurately and effectively. This development opens up new possibilities for businesses of all sizes to leverage ChatGPT and deliver enhanced conversational experiences to their customers.
  
The landscape of content creation and journalism is undergoing a significant transformation with the assistance of ChatGPT and AI-generated images. ChatGPT is revolutionizing the writing process by providing valuable assistance and generating engaging content, while professional newspapers are already leveraging AI to create visually stunning images that accompany their articles. These advancements are reshaping the way content is produced, enhancing its quality and efficiency, and signaling a new era of AI-powered support in the realm of media and publishing.

## Ethical Considerations and Transparency
The use of AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E brings forth important ethical considerations. One of the key challenges is the identification and combatting of fake news, as AI-generated content can potentially contribute to misinformation and manipulation. Additionally, ensuring transparency in AI-generated content and addressing concerns regarding authorship and intellectual property rights are crucial for maintaining ethical standards and promoting responsible use of these technologies.

With the advancements in AI tools, there are discussions about the future role of traditional blogs and human-authored content. While AI assistance offers efficiency and productivity gains, it is important to recognize the value of human creativity, unique perspectives, and expertise. Striking a balance between AI-generated content and human-authored contributions is essential to maintain a diverse and trustworthy information landscape. The focus should be on leveraging AI as a supportive tool to augment human capabilities rather than replacing human creativity and individual voices. This way, we can harness the potential of AI while preserving the integrity and authenticity of content creation in the digital age.

At this blog I personally try to be very transparent when it comes to usage of AI tools. I want to ensure complete transparency in my process, and as such, I openly disclose that I utilize ChatGPT for every article. In an effort to provide even greater transparency, I am currently working on implementing a feature that will capture and document my conversations with ChatGPT, which will be shared alongside my articles. Additionally, when it comes to DALL-E generated images, I consciously leave the DALL-E dot signatures intact at the bottom right corner as a testament to their origin. Moreover, I use the DALL-E prompts I provided as alt texts for those images, further showcasing the collaborative nature of their creation.

## Conclusion
  In summary, the integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E has brought about significant changes to our daily lives. These tools have evolved from specialized applications into versatile assistants that offer invaluable support across various domains.

From a personal standpoint, ChatGPT has become an indispensable resource, aiding in technical information retrieval, learning new programming languages, and enhancing the writing process. Its capabilities have proven invaluable in generating ideas, refining content, and improving overall productivity.

As we move forward, the integration of AI into everyday life offers exciting possibilities for enhanced productivity and creativity. Through the use of AI, we can leverage its capabilities to augment our abilities, expand our knowledge, and shape a future where human-machine collaboration drives innovation and enriches our lives.
